Hi, I am workig with a table extracted from a PDF so it is quite messy. I need to concatenate the lines, the code I have is incomplete and I'm not sure how to fix it:
import sys

# Assigning count number and getting rid of right space
def main():
	count = 0
	pieces = []
	for line in open(infile, 'U'):
		if count < 130: 
			data = line.replace('"', '').rstrip().split("\t")
			data = clean_data(data) 
			if data[1] == "year" and data[1] != "":
				write_pieces(pieces)
				pieces = data
				str.join(pieces)
			else: 
				for i in range(len(data)):
					pieces[i] = pieces[i] + data[i]
					str.join(pieces)

# Executing command to remove right space
def clean_data(s): 
	return [x.rstrip() for x in s]

def write_pieces(pieces):
	print 

if __name__ == '__main__':
	infile = "turtles_for_meg.txt"
	main()
	
	ALL help would be appreciated :)
